# Functions
1. User Registration
Enables new users to create accounts in the internet messenger. During registration, users provide a unique username and a securely encrypted password. The system ensures privacy protection through robust encryption mechanisms.

2. User Login
Provides a login interface where registered users enter their username and encrypted password to access the messenger. Encryption mechanisms secure the data during the login process, guaranteeing information security.

3. HTTPS Protocol
All communication between the client and server occurs via the HTTPS protocol, ensuring a secure data transmission. This security measure protects against data interception by third parties and maintains the confidentiality of user-transmitted information.

4. Data Encryption
Communication between users is encrypted, meaning that even if data is intercepted, the information remains unreadable. Data encryption provides an additional layer of security, safeguarding private conversations and content exchanged between users.

5. Password Security
User passwords are stored in the database in encrypted form, protecting them from unauthorized access. The use of strong hashing algorithms, such as SHA-256, ensures the security of stored data.

6. Session Management
The system manages login sessions, automatically logging users out after a specified period of inactivity, thereby enhancing the security of user accounts.

7. Security Monitoring
The internet messenger system can be equipped with security monitoring mechanisms, such as logging unsuccessful login attempts or monitoring user activity to detect potential threats.

With these features, the internet messenger becomes a secure tool for conducting private online conversations, safeguarding user privacy and data.
